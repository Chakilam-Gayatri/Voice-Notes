# Voice-Notes
An audio journal.
'Voice Notes' is a user-friendly project using React for the frontend, Auth0 for authentication, Express for the backend, and MongoDB Atlas for cloud storage. It lets you easily record voice notes, and with OpenAI's Whisper model, converts them to text for convenient reading and editing later.
